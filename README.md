## üìå Project Overview

Credit card fraud detection is a critical challenge due to **extreme class imbalance**. This project builds a **1D CNN-based deep learning model** capable of learning hidden patterns in transaction data to detect fraudulent activity with **exceptionally high precision and recall**.

‚úÖ Uses strategic data balancing  
‚úÖ Builds an optimized CNN pipeline  
‚úÖ Delivers real-world production-level accuracy

## üìÇ Dataset Information

- **üì¶ Source**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **üßÆ Features**:
  - `V1-V28`: PCA-anonymized features
  - `Time`: Seconds since first transaction
  - `Amount`: Transaction amount
- **üéØ Target**: `Class` (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Class Imbalance**: Only 0.172% fraudulent samples (492 out of 284,807)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology & Implementation

A structured approach from raw data to model evaluation üìä.

### üîß Data Preparation

- üß± **Library Setup & Reproducibility**: TensorFlow, Sklearn, Pandas, Random Seeds
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Balanced Sampling**: 10:1 ratio of non-fraud to fraud to retain contextual information
- ‚úÇÔ∏è **Train-Test Split**: 80/20 with stratification to preserve class ratio
- üßº **Standardization**: `StandardScaler` applied only to training set
- üìê **Reshaping**: Converted to `(samples, timesteps, features)` for CNN

### üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture (CNN Implementation)

A deep and regularized 1D CNN model:

- üß† `Conv1D` Layers: 64 and 128 filters to learn complex features
- üîÑ `BatchNormalization`: Faster & more stable training
- üö´ `Dropout`: Prevents overfitting
- üîÅ `Flatten` + `Dense`: Final prediction via sigmoid activation

> **Optimizer**: Adam  
> **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy

### üéØ Training Strategy

- üìâ `ReduceLROnPlateau`: Dynamic learning rate tuning
- üõë `EarlyStopping`: Stops training at best validation performance
- üóìÔ∏è Trained for up to **20 epochs** with **batch size = 256**
